scrollstyle
===========

Browser Scroll initiated CSS transition/animation library

Allows for content to be animated on browser scroll by initiating CSS animations/transitions.


#####Usage:

Simply apply an animation class to the element you wish to animate into view when the user scrolls to it, then either add the class `.ss-scroll-trigger` to it directly, or a parent element. When the top of the element with the `.ss-scroll-trigger` class is 10% from the bottom of the browser viewport, the content will be animated.

#####Available animation classes:
```
.ss-fadeIn
.ss-flipY
.ss-flipX
.ss-swingInUp
.ss-swingInDown
.ss-swingInRight
.ss-swingInLeft
.ss-slideInUp
.ss-slideInDown
.ss-slideInRight
.ss-slideInLeft
.ss-ripple
```
